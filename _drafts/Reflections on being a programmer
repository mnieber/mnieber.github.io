Reflections on being a programmer
=================================

What is good about being a programmer
-------------------------------------

- The satisfaction of creating things, that impact the world
- Conceptualizing and abstracting things is fun
- Salary and work conditions
- Challenging, but not rocket science
- It's a craft, in which you can (potentially) gain mastery
- Offers both interaction and solitude

What's not so good
------------------

- Messing up and feeling bad about that (the genius-to-shit-head rollercoaster)
- Tedious work
- Potential for escapism
- At times you can start feeling somewhat like a robot
- It can be hard to reach consensus with colleagues


What to do when you are stuck
-----------------------------

1 Ignore the feelings of failure
1.1. Patience and determination will get you there
2 Take a step back
2.1 Maybe things are not working out because you are pushing
down a path that is not the right one
2.2 Maybe try throwing code away, take a break and start fresh
2.3 Take smaller steps. Aim at something simpler first.
